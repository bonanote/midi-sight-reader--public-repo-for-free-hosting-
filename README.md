This is a simple web-based app for practicing music sight reading. The interface should be self-explanatory. It works on Google Chrome; I don't know if it can work on other browsers, such as Brave or Firefox.When you first load the page, you need to select your MIDI controller and set the one you intend to use. This immediately generates a staff with random notes. You can adjust most of the parameters for the random note generation. For example, you can choose how many notes to generate, from a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 30. You can also set the maximum jumps between notes, from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 18—this doesn't mean all notes will jump by that amount, but rather that it is the maximum allowed randomly. I thought this could be useful for beginners, who can start with, say, an interval of 2 or 3 jumps and then gradually increase to larger distances between notes. (I basically created this to learn fingering on a wind controller, which only plays one note at a time. Frequently, changing octaves requires using a roller or extra button, which initially makes it somewhat more complicated to learn.)You can also adjust the range of notes to be displayed via the two controls provided for that purpose. Additionally, you can practice the whole range of notes—that is, natural notes, sharps, and flats—or you can choose only naturals, only sharps, only flats, or any combination of them. There is an option to turn on/off note display in plain text as a help, turn on/off a very basic sound, and more.The app also provides some statistics that show the frequency of wrong notes and the time it takes you to identify notes. There is a button that shows the full statistics if you want to really understand how the randomness is behaving.Basically, the app works by identifying the right note when you play it, highlighting it in green, or in red if you fail. It will not let you proceed to the next note until you play it correctly. Under the hood, it has a function that identifies—for each session—the notes you frequently play wrongly and gives them extra weight in the random generation each time you finish a set and the next one is redrawn.Warning: I am far from being a coder. I just created this out of frustration because, although there are many apps out there that teach music sight reading, the ones I've tried are always missing something or, at least, did not cater to my specific needs. There is one app, "Sightreading.training," which comes as close as it gets to what I needed. However, in its chromatic training mode—the most basic one, which I think anybody should first learn to read all possible notes (naturals, sharps, and flats)—it does not show flat notes, only sharps, and the note range goes up only to C7. In any case, it is a very good app and would be a natural next step after using this one, which is more basic. Not knowing too much about programming, I relied heavily on Grok to do the coding.Please let me know any issues you have. I'll try to do my best to solve them, but don't count on it. If you want, feel free to modify the code to fit your needs or even improve it.
